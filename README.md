# `ffprobe-static-electron`

The module returns a file path to the binary for the target operating system. 

It is a modified version from the original [ffprobe-static](https://github.com/pietrop/ffprobe-static) to use [`electron-builder` file macros  in `package.json`, where OS name are `mac`, `linux` or `win`](https://www.electron.build/file-patterns/#file-macros)

In `ffprobe-static`, recognising the target OS is done with [`os.platform()`](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_platform) where mac os x is  recognised as`darwin` rather then `mac`.

The need to tailor ffmpeg-static to use with `electron-builder` came from a use cases such as that of [autoEdit.io](http://autoEdit.io). 

<!-- I've also added `browser`, as a platform option, for use case when module is use client side, eg bundled using browserify.-->
